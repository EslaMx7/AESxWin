Encrypt\Decrypt file(s) with [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) 256-bit
===============================

### Description
This is a personal tool i just made for a specific purpose (encrypt multiple files at once to securely backup them on a cloud service) then i decided to add some features and improve the UI(actualy create the UI) to make it used for general purposes.

I'm using the [C# implementation](https://github.com/kenkendk/sharpaescrypt) of a well-known open source AES encryption library called [AES Crypt](https://www.aescrypt.com/) which means you can use their cross platform tools to decrypt the files you just encrypted with this tool.
